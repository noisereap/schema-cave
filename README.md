Various old schematics of retired and unreleased modules. 
I've used different versions of Kicad and operating systems throughout the years so some elements might be wonky, missing, or broken.
Also, some of these are not *good* designs. But all in all most stuff here should be working and at least breadboarded. Could be fun for DIYers.

Use these however you want. Commercially etc. 100% open source.
